*Where Lapdogs Bark Louder Than Watchdogs*

Welcome to **Godi Media Unmasked**, an open-source project dedicated to exposing the circus of biased media with satire, facts, and a healthy dose of humor. Hosted at [https://godi-modi.github.io/](https://godi-modi.github.io/), this is a battle for awarenessâ€”a space for patriots to call out the boot-polishing, decibel-driven nonsense masquerading as journalism. Join the fight, contribute, and letâ€™s unmask the circus together!

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi (add more languages by contributing!).
- **Hall of Shame**: A satirical showcase of media absurdities (no real names, just witty placeholders).
- **Fact vs. Fiction**: Separating WhatsApp University myths from reality.
- **Meme Zone**: Coming soonâ€”add your own memes to roast the circus!
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

### Updates Made:
1. **Live Demo Link**: Changed to your actual GitHub Pages URL: `https://godi-modi.github.io/`.
2. **Clone URL**: Updated to `https://github.com/godi-modi/godi-media-unmasked.git` based on your username (`godi-modi`).
3. **Contact Section**: Removed the X handle placeholder since you didnâ€™t provide one, and directed users to open issues instead.
4. **Banner**: Still using a placeholder image. If youâ€™d like, you can create a banner (e.g., 800x200px) and upload it to your repo as `banner.png`, then update the line to `![Banner](banner.png)`.

3. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push the `README.md` to make it visible on your repo page.

This README should attract contributors and clearly explain how to get involved. Let me know if you want to add more sections or refine it further!
