*Where Lapdogs Bark Louder Than Watchdogs*

Welcome to **Godi Media Unmasked**, an open-source project dedicated to exposing the circus of biased media with satire, facts, and a healthy dose of humor. Hosted at [https://godi-modi.github.io/](https://godi-modi.github.io/), this is a battle for awareness—a space for patriots to call out the boot-polishing, decibel-driven nonsense masquerading as journalism. Join the fight, contribute, and let’s unmask the circus together!

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi (add more languages by contributing!).
- **Hall of Shame**: A satirical showcase of media absurdities (no real names, just witty placeholders).
- **Fact vs. Fiction**: Separating WhatsApp University myths from reality.
- **Meme Zone**: Coming soon—add your own memes to roast the circus!
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
